# AQA-ASCII-art-NEA
NEA programming project for AQA GCSE summer 2020.
This is my programming project for the AQA GCSE computer science.
It is a required part of the GCSE and I am storing it on github for ease of use. 
It involves converting a piece of ASCII art into encoded data. 
The compression used is run length encoding which involves counting the number of a specific digit and recording a single digit and the number of that digit preceding it.
This project requires encoding only up to and including 99 digits and must be able to compress letters and numbers.
